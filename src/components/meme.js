//  they left the statement data.data.memes that i had changed and was casueing the error, after chanegs on line 89 error was no longer running

     * Challenge: 
     * As soon as the Meme component loads the first time,
     * make an API call to "https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes".
     * 
     * When the data comes in, save just the memes array part
     * of that data to the `allMemes` state
     * 
     * Think about if there are any dependencies that, if they
     * changed, you'd want to cause to re-run this function.
     * 
     * Hint: for now, don't try to use an async/await function.
     * Instead, use `.then()` blocks to resolve the promises
     * from using `fetch`. We'll learn why after this challenge.
